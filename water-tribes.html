    <div class="text-block"> <p>The Northern and Southern Water Tribes are located at the coldest extremes of the Avatar globeâ€”similar to the Inuit, who are located in Arctic and Subarctic regions of the Earth (Greenland, Siberia, Canada, etc.).</p>
     <p>The Southern Water Tribe has ice houses and tents inspired by the Inuits. An ice house, also called an "igloo" or an "aputiak", is a domed wintertime dwelling made out of blocks of ice. The tents, called "tupiq" singular and "tupiit" plural, are summertime tents traditionally made of sealskin, but more recently made of cloth.</p>
     <p>Although most of the landscape and housing depicted in the Water Tribes derives from Inuit lanscapes and architecture, the royal palace of the Northern Water Tribe is based on a traditional Hindu structure called a "gopura" or "gopuram", a tower entryway found in front of Hindu temples.</p>

    <div class="text-block"> <p>Because the Water Tribes and the Inuit are located in similar regions with frigid climates, they have similar manners of dress. The fur-lined coats of the Water Tribes are based on Inuit anoraks (more commonly known as parkas), and their boots resemble traditional Inuit mukluks, soft boots designed for cold weather.</p>
     <p>The iconic Water Tribe hairstyle of two strands of hair pulled back into loose loops (dubbed "hair loopies" by Sokka) were inspired by the traditional Inuit hairstyle pictured to the right.</p>

    <h2 class="block-title">Martial Arts & Weapons</h2>
    <p class="image-label-left">Images from Avatar</p>
    <p class="image-label-right">The Asian Inspiration</p>
    <div class="text-block"> <p>The fighting style of the waterbenders is based on the ancient Chinese martial art of Tai Chi. Much like Tai Chi, waterbending is less about raw strength than it is about breath, alignment, and clarity. Rather than opposing an incoming attack head-on, both Tai Chi and waterbending change and yield to the attack, redirecting the energy of your opponent back at them. Both styles focus on the philosophy of yin and yang, opposite but equal energies fusing together.</p>
     <p>The weaponry of the Water Tribes is clearly inspired by Inuit weaponry. Inuit weapons, such as the war club and the spear pictured below, are made from bones and used as both hunting tools and weapons. Sokka's beloved boomerang is based on the boomerang of the aboriginal Australians, used for hunting, warfare, and occasionally as artwork.</p>
