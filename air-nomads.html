    <div class="text-block"> <p>Air Nomads are located in elevated, isolated areas, much like how the Tibetan Buddhist monks are isolated among the many mountain ranges in Tibet.</p>
     <p>The Eastern, Northern, and Southern Air Temples are based on traditional Buddhist temples. The Western Air Temple (2nd row) was inspired by the Pagoda Forest at Shaolin Temple in China. The pagodas of the Western Air Temple were built upside down into the underside of a cliff.</p>

    <div class="text-block"> <p>The robes of Air Nomads are modeled after the traditional saffron robes of a Buddhist monk, also called kasaya. Aang's robes have been modified slightly for better mobility, with shorter, more fitted pants. As shown in the 3rd row, Monk Gyatso wears a Buddhist japamala, a string of prayer beads with symbolic charms and tassels.</p>
     <p>As per the tradition of Buddhist monks, all Air Nomads have their heads shaved. This practice is called tonsure, and it symbolizes letting go of worldly attachments. Aang's blue airbending tattoos, similar to Tibetan Sak Yant tattoos, are a sacred symbol of power, enlightenment, and knowledge.</p>

    <div class="text-block"> <p>The movements of the airbenders were inspired by the Chinese martial art Baguazhang. The philosophy of Baguazhang is based on the circle. In this style, one is constantly moving in continuous circlesâ€”walking in circles, moving their arms in circles, turning on the axis of their body. Airbenders and practitioners of Baguazhang must float like leaves in the breeze, able to feel the direction that their opponent's energy is heading and turn on a dime to dodge it.</p>
     <p>Aang's use of his staff is reminiscent of the use of a bagua staff. However, unlike Aang's staff, the typical bagua staff does not double as a glider.</p>

    <div class="text-block"> <p>The Air Nomads are all deeply in tune with their minds and spirits. The Hindu concept of chakras is used throughout the show. Chakras are 7 spinning discs of energy that run along your spine, from the crown of your head to your tailbone. Each one deals with and is blocked by different emotions. When the energy, or chi, running through your chakras is blocked, you will feel emotionally and spiritually distressed.</p>
     <p>Also similar to Hinduism, where many people choose to be vegetarian, all Air Nomads are strictly vegetarian because they view all life as sacred and want to minimize the pain they cause other living organisms.</p>
