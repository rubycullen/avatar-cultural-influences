    <div class="text-block"> <p>The location in relation to other nations and immense size of the Earth Kingdom is reminiscent of modern-day China. The Si Wong desert in the Earth Kingdom is similar to the Gobi desert in northern China.</p>
      <p>The architecture of the Earth Kingdom Palace (pictured to the right) is similar to that of the meridian gate to the Forbidden City in Beijing, China, the largest imperial palace in the world. The impenetrable wall of Ba Sing Se is perhaps the most obvious reference to Asian culture throughout Avatar; the walls surrounding Ba Sing Se are modeled after the ancient Great Wall of China. </p>
      <p>Kyoshi Island, an island located off the southern coast of the Earth Kingdom, is likely a reference to Taiwan in that the island had been separated from the mainland and now remains a mostly independent entity. The architecture of Kyoshi Island mostly resembles Japanese architecture.</p>

    <div class="text-block"> <p>The majority of Earth Kingdom attire is based on the clothing from the Qing and Tang Dynasties in China. Earth Kingdom women often wear cheongsams (1st row) or Tang Dynasty dresses (2nd row). In a season 2 episode, we meet Song and her mother, an Earth Kingdom family that wears traditional Korean hanboks (pictured in the 3rd row).</p>
     <p>Throughout the show, multiple characters can be seen wearing hats and headdresses based on the traditional fashion of the Manchu, an ethnic group from northern China. The traditional Manchu hairstyle of the half-shaved head with a long braid is worn by many upper-class Earth Kingdom men.</p>
     <p>The all-female Kyoshi Warriors of Kyoshi Island wear armor that resembles the armor of Japanese samurai. Their makeup draws inspiration from traditional Chinese opera makeup.</p>

    <h2 class="block-title">Martial Arts & Weapons</h2>
    <p class="image-label-left">Images from Avatar</p>
    <p class="image-label-right">The Asian Inspiration</p>
    <div class="text-block"> <p>The vast majority of earthbenders have a fighting style similar to the Chinese martial art Hung Gar Kung Fu, which emphasizes strong stances, and sharp, powerful hand movements. Hung Gar, like earthbending, is about rooting yourself to the ground and using a solid stance to draw strength from the earth below you. In order to earthbend successfully, you must be as tough and headstrong as the rock you're bending.</p>
     <p>However, Toph, a 12-year-old blind girl, uses a separate style of Kung Fu known as Chu Gar Southern Praying Mantis style. She is the only character in the show who uses this style of fighting. Southern Praying Mantis Kung Fu is focused on practicality and efficiency, using minimal effort to achieve maximum force. Rather than using full fists or knuckles to attack an opponent, this style uses different parts of the hand (the side of the hand, the palm, a single knuckle) for precision. The lower half of the body is used less for kicks and more for stepping patterns, which Toph uses to feel vibrations through the earth in order to see. In this style, you must wait and listen for the right moment to strike.</p>
     <p>The Kyoshi Warriors are composed entirely of non-benders that use metal fans as weapons, similar to the Japanese martial art Tessenjutsu.</p>

    <div class="text-block">
     <p>Similar to the last emperor of China, Puyi, the Earth King is a puppet emperor, controlled by his advisors and his grand secretariat, Long Feng.</p>
      <p>The immensity and diversity of the Earth Kingdom populace is very similar to that of China. People of a myriad of different skin tones, facial features, and cultures make up the Earth Kingdom population. The disparity between economic classes in the Earth Kingdom is also similar to China. In both nations, the small upper class is far richer than the huge lower class. In the Earth Kingdom's capital city of Ba Sing Se, there are literal walls between the different castes—the Upper Ring contains all the nation's richest and most privileged, including the Earth King and his advisors, while the Lower Ring has all the nation's poorest—refugees, artists, peddlers, living all crammed together.</p>
