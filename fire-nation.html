    <div class="text-block"> <p>Fire Nation is a crescent-shaped tropical archipelago with many volcanoes, just like Japan. The Fire Colonies established in the Earth Kingdoms resemble the Japanese Colonial Empire established by Imperial Japan in the late 1800s-early 1900s.</p>
     <p>The architecture of the Fire Nation was mainly influenced by Japanese and Thai architecture. One of the few exceptions is the Fire Nation Royal Palace, which was loosely based on the palace of the Forbidden City in Beijing, China (pictured in the top row), but still retains the sloped roofs of Japan and the ornate golden roof edges of Thailand.</p>
     <p>The angled roof structure of the Fire Nation building in the second row is reminiscent of traditional Japanese sloped roofs. The design and location of the Fire Temple (3rd row) is similar to that of the Yellow Crane Tower, a temple built on a hill in what is now Wuhan, China. The architecture of the Royal Family Beach House on Ember Island in the Fire Nation (last row) was inspired by Thai architecture, both in the design of the roof and the stilts that hold the house above sea level.</p>

    <div class="text-block"> <p>Fire Nation attire is very loosely based on traditional Japanese clothing. The armor of Fire Nation soldiers is similar to the armor of Japanese samurai, with elements of traditional Chinese cord-and-plaque armor. The dramatic horns on the helmets of the Fire Nation soldiers is similar to the adornments found on samurai helmets. The more casual clothing of Fire Nation citizens is also based on samurai clothing.</p>
     <p>In the Fire Nation, hair symbolizes someone's honor. All upper-class Fire Nation citizens have a top knot or ponytail that sigfinies their status. After being disgraced, one might shave their hair, leaving a patch surrounding their top knot. The top knot is only cut in circumstances akin to death. This is similar to the significance that the Japanese samurai's top knot, or chonmage, holds. Samurai would only cut their chonmage if they were incurably dishonored. The hairstyles of Fire Nation women resemble the hairstyles of the Edo Period in Japan.</p>
     <p>Zuko's Blue Spirit mask is based on the style of the Japanese hannya mask, used in ritual dances. During the Fire Festival in a Fire Nation town, Aang, Katara, and Sokka dress up in masks inspired by traditional Japanese theatre masks. In a small Fire Nation town that appears in season 3, there is a spirit called The Painted Lady. Her markings appear to be inspired by traditional Japanese opera makeup and her veiled hat resembles the traditional veiled hat of a geisha.</p>

    <div class="text-block"> <p>The firebending fighting style is based on Northern Shaolin Kung Fu. Northern Shaolin is more about the external rather than the internal, resulting in explosive, dynamic motion and a focus on high kicks and aerobics. The Northern Shaolin style and firebending both place great emphasis on quick advances and retreats, leaps and kicks, aggressive attacks, and the ability to quickly change direction.</p>
     <p>Zuko's double swords are based on the Japanese daisho, a pair of katanas of slightly different sizes used by samurai.</p>

    <div class="text-block"> <p>Honor and filial piety (the obedience of your parents/superiors) in the Fire Nation are both very important values in Chinese and Japanese society, and to bring dishonor or shame to your family is seen as highly offensive.</p>
     <p>The Imperialistic outlook of the Fire Nation is very similar to that of Imperial Japan. The actions of the Fire Nation resemble those of Japan when they occupied Korea, China, and various Southeast Asian countries. These countries served as the inspiration for the Earth Kingdom, which was mostly occupied by Fire Nation troops during Avatar. </p>
     <p>After meeting Song, an Earth Kingdom girl dressed in a Korean hanbok, she reveals that Fire Nation soldiers had taken her father and scarred her leg. Imperial Japan committed similar atrocities during their occupation of Korea and other countries, torturing and killing millions of people.</p>
     <p>In season 3, Aang goes undercover at a Fire Nation school for a day. During the lesson, the teacher says that the Fire Nation defeated the armies of the Air Nomads, Aang's people. Aang stands up and corrects her, saying that the Fire Nationa actually ambushed them because the Air Nomads didn't have an army. The teacher scolds him, telling him that he can't possibly know more than the official history text written by the government. This censorship in Fire Nation schools is similar to the censorship in Japanese schools. In Japan, many events are brushed over or twisted in history lessons, such as the Rape of Nanjing, one of the most brutal massacres ever committed by Japan. Many history textbooks wrote in a mere footnote on the subject, and others claimed that nothing had even happened, that the Chinese had hired actors to act like victims.</p>
